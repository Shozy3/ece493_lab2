**Goal in Context**: An administrator requests the system to generate a conference schedule in HTML format so it can be distributed.

**Scope**: Conference Management System

**Level**: User Goal

**Primary Actor**: Administrator

**Secondary Actors**: Scheduling Algorithm (Algorithm X), Database, Authors

**Trigger**: Administrator requests the conference schedule.

### Success End Condition
* Schedule is generated in HTML format, displayed to administrator, and sent to authors of accepted papers.

### Failed End Condition
* Schedule is not generated, and administrator is notified of the failure.

### Preconditions
* There are accepted papers to schedule.

### Main Success Scenario
1. Administrator requests schedule.
2. System uses algorithm X to generate schedule in HTML format.
3. System displays schedule in HTML.
4. System sends schedule to authors of accepted papers.

### Extensions
* **2a**: Algorithm X fails or produces invalid schedule
  * 2a1: System displays error message indicating schedule generation failure.
  * 2a2: Administrator may retry or contact technical support.

### Related Information
* **Priority**: High
* **Frequency**: Occasional (typically once per conference)
* **Open Issues**: Algorithm X details not specified in SRS
